## Memory Game

An interactive memory card game built with React and Tailwind CSS, designed to practice component-based architecture, state management, and responsive UI development. The game challenges players to match pairs of cards and tracking number of turns to match all the cards.

## Approach

- Built the game interface using React functional components and hooks for efficient state and effect handling.
- Implemented card shuffling, matching logic, scoring system, and timer functionality.
- Styled the UI with Tailwind CSS to ensure a responsive, mobile-friendly design.
- Used transitions and animations for smooth card flip effects and visual feedback.

## Ongoing Development

1. Adding images in the places of colour in boxes according to movies themes.
2. Deployment in server.
